Git is a popular and powerful version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the Linux kernel development. Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project and track changes made by each of them. It offers features such as branching, merging, and tagging to help manage code versions, and provides a history of changes made to the code. Git is widely used in the software development industry, and it has become an essential tool for developers to work effectively and efficiently in teams.
