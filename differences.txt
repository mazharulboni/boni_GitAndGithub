Git and GitHub are two distinct but related technologies. Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code over time and collaborate with others on code projects. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting platform for Git repositories that provides additional features for managing and sharing code.

Here are some of the key differences between Git and GitHub:

Git is a command-line tool that is installed on a local computer, whereas GitHub is a web-based platform that is accessed through a browser.

Git allows developers to track changes in source code, manage branches and merge conflicts, and collaborate with others on code projects. GitHub provides additional features such as project management tools, issue tracking, and pull requests that make it easier to manage larger code projects.

Git can be used on its own, without any connection to GitHub. GitHub, on the other hand, requires a Git repository to be hosted on its platform.

Git is a free and open-source software that can be used on any operating system, whereas GitHub offers both free and paid plans with additional features.

Git can be used for any type of file, not just code files. GitHub is primarily used for hosting Git repositories containing code projects, although it can be used for other types of files as well.

In summary, Git is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides additional features for managing and sharing code. While Git can be used on its own, GitHub makes it easier to collaborate with others and manage larger code projects.
